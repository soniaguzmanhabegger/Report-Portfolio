## 🚀 About Me 
I'm a data analyst passionate about helping businesses make sense of their data. I enjoy transforming complex, messy datasets into clear stories and actionable insights.

My focus is on building dashboards that get used, automating repetitive tasks to free up teams for more interesting problems, and creating models that help businesses plan for the future.

When I'm not working with data, I enjoy scrapbooking, preparing trips with storyboarding, and listening to music.
